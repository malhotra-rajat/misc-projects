		“Lets talk Workouts!” now does that for you.

    <string name="about_usage_tts_text">
        When you click on the Begin Workout Button, the app will first prompt you to speak I just did and will begin listening. 
        Once you have spoken I Just Did, 
        the app asks you for the exercise name. After you have spoken the exercise name, the app will ask you for reps followed 
        by pounds. Once you have spoken all these details, the app will prompt you to speak either Save, to save the details, 
        or Cancel, to cancel the entry. You can also speak Cancel anytime if the speech has been incorrectly recognized to go back to the first state where you have to speak I just did.
        Kindly make sure that you speak only after the beep which follows each prompt from the app. 
        You can also input exercise details data by clicking on the Add Exercise Manually button on the Begin Workout Screen. 
        To view the exercises supported by the app, click on View Supported Exercises button on the app\'s main screen.
        To view all your previous workouts, click on the View Previous Workouts Button on the app\'s main screen. Here you can 
        click on the dates which will take you to the workouts performed on that specific date. 
        You\'re now ready to begin your workout session. Click on Go Back To Begin Workout Button.</string>
