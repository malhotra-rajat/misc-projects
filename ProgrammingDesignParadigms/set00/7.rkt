;; DATA DEFINITIONS: none

; circumference : Number -> Number
; GIVEN: the radius r of a circle 
; RETURNS: its circumference, using the formula 2 * pi * r.
; Examples:
; (circumference 1)  =>  6.283185307179586 
; (circumference 0)  =>  0

(define (circumference r)
  (* 2 pi r))

;; TESTS:
 (check-equal? (circumference 1) #i6.283185307179586  "Square of 10 is 100")
 (check-equal? (circumference 0) 0 "Square of 20 is 400")
