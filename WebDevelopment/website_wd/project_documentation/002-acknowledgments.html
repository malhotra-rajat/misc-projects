            <li><b>CS5610: Web development</b> is one of the most practice oriented courses that I have taken in my masters program. Learning by experimenting has been a great experience, under the guidance of an eminent faculty. </li>

            <li>I want to thank <b>Prof. Jose Annunziato</b> for such a good course! Ever so nice and helpful, Prof. Annunziato is a genius at Web Development and his classes were always so interesting.</li>

            <li>My TA <b>Tushar Gupta</b> has been a constant source of inspiration and encouragement throughout the course. The weekly reviews and feedbacks were immensely helpful in keeping me on track.</li>

            <li>Thank you so much for such a great learning experience!</li>
