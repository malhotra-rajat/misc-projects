<h3>Experiment 1</h3>

<p>
    This week I did my first few experiments for the Web Development course.
    My experiments were on CSS3 and Responsive web design using media queries.
    I am trying to follow all the design guidelines and coding standards which
    I am sure will help me a lot in the future.
