<h3>Experiment 4</h3>

<p>
    This week I worked on: <br />
    - AngularJS Form Validation <br />
    - Node.js server hosting static content using Express.js <br />
    - Retrieving data from MongoDB <br />
    I really learned a good deal about Node.js, MongoDb and Express.js and am really excited to advance my
    knowledge in these technologies.
