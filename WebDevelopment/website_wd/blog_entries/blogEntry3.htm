<h3>Experiment 3</h3>

<p>
    This week I did experiments on: <br />
    - JSON Data Persistence using jQuery Cookie <br />
    - jQuery Plugins <br />
    - jQuery UI Sortable Widget <br />
    - Embedding Google Maps <br />
    Persisting JSON data in a Cookie was really cool for an experiment since I extended a class demo of 
    Professor Jose's in which he worked on JSON data using AngularJS.
