<h3>Experiment 2</h3>

<p>
    This week I used Bootstrap and AngularJS in my experiments. I played around with
    the Bootstrap Grid System, Jumbotron, Hover Table and Alternate Progress Bar.
    I also used the HTML5 audio tag and controlled its playback using AngularJS.
    Next week I hope to use a Web API which returns JSON data and display it using
    AngularJS and Bootstrap.
