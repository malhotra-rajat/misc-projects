            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 
            3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and weighing up to 388.7 kg (857 lb) in the wild. 
            Its most recognisable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange 
            fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar 
            and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They
             are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat 
            that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more 
            densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.

        </div>
        <div id="tabs-2">
            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family 
            Felidae. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after 
            the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant
             population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared 
            from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years
             ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa,
             across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion 
            is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30–50% per 
            two decades during the second half of the 20th century. Lion populations are untenable outside
             designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, 
            habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa,
             the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>

             inhabiting most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the only extant member of the genus Acinonyx. 
            The cheetah can run faster than any other land animal— as fast as 112 to 120 km/h (70 to 75 mph)
             in short bursts covering distances up to 500 m (1,600 ft), and has the ability to accelerate from 
            0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in three seconds.</p>

        In this experiment, I played with the JQueryUI tabs. Code snippet below:
