                    Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications.
                    It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation
                    and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. In June 2014 it
                    was the No.1 project on GitHub with 71,000+ stars and 26,000+ forks, with a user
                    base including MSNBC and NASA.

                    Bootstrap is compatible with the latest versions of all major browsers. It gracefully
                    degrades when used on older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8. Since version 2.0 it
                    also supports responsive web design. This means the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically,
                    taking into account the characteristics of the device used (desktop, tablet, mobile phone).
                    Starting with version 3.0, Bootstrap adopted a mobile first design philosophy, emphasizing
                    responsive design by default. Bootstrap is open source and available on GitHub.
                    Developers are encouraged to participate in the project and make their own contributions to the platform.
                    Recently, community members have translated Bootstrap's documentation into various languages,
                    including Chinese, Spanish and Russian.

            In this experiment, using Bootstrap, I gave 3 different column layouts at
            each point for the 2 divs. On a phone, it will be 25% on the left, and 75% on the right. 
            On a tablet, it will be 50%/50%, and on a large viewport, 
            it will be 33%/66%. 3 different layouts for each of the 3 responsive sizes. The following Bootsrap classes 
            used in conjunction on the left and right divs help us achieve this.
