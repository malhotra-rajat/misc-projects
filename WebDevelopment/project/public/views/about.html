            <b>Moviebook</b> is a social networking web application with movie data from the Rotten Tomatoes API. It allows people to create their profiles, like and comment on movies and follow other users.
            It is a MEAN (MongoDb, Express, Angular, Nodejs) stack web application so the performance is super fast. There are no full page refreshes except when the user logs in or logs out. The web app is responsive,
            so it works well on smaller screens.

            The Rotten Tomatoes API provides access to Rotten Tomatoes' ratings and reviews, allowing one to build applications and widgets enriched with Rotten Tomatoes data.

            Moviebook has the following features:

            <ul>
